Riptide is a set of tools to manage development environments for web applications.
It's using container virtualization tools, such as `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_
to run all services needed for a project.

It's goal is to be easy to use by developers.
Riptide abstracts the virtualization in such a way that the environment behaves exactly
as if you were running it natively, without the need to install any other requirements
the project may have.
