Installing Requirements
-----------------------

This guide assumes you want to run Riptide in the most common set-up using the Docker Engine.
To use Riptide you need to have the following installed:

* Python 3.7+
* `Docker 16.0+ <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`_ (Linux)
* `Docker Desktop 16.0+ <https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop>`_ (Mac, Windows)

Python is available for Linux and Mac machines using package managers.
For Windows it can be downloaded on the `Python website <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.

There is a good chance you already have Python installed. Try running ``python3 --version`` to check.
