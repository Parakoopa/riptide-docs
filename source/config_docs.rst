Configuration Guide
-------------------

Welcome to the Riptide Configuration Guide.

This guide will guide you through writing your own Riptide projects. It explains the mechanics
of the YAML-based configuration language and the different entities that control how Riptide projects
behave.

The Chapter `How Riptide works <config_docs/entities.html>`_ explains the mechanics of the Riptide configuration
and what repositories are.

The Chapter `Entities <config_docs/entities.html>`_ contains the specification of all entities.

`Examples <config_docs/using_repo.html>`_ shows you how to get quickly started
by creating projects based on templates from the
`Riptide Community Repository <config_docs/using_repo/community_repo.html>`_.
